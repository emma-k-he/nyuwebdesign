				Hello, my name is Emma. I am an NYU Shanghai student and I am currently a Freshman.
				I moved here from Seattle but I am from upstate New York.
			  I enjoy working out, going out to restaurants and listening to music.
				My favorite animals include dogs, cats, and frogs.
				I like the colors, blue, pink, purple, orange and yellow. Colors you can see in a sunset.
